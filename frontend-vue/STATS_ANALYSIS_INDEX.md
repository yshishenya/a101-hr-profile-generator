## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Component Creation (1-2 hours)
Create `StatsCard` component with standardized:
- Typography (24px values, 12px uppercase labels)
- Icon sizing (semantic x-large)
- Progress bar heights (4px)
- Spacing (flexbox gap 12px)
- Responsive design (media queries)

### Phase 2: DashboardView Update (1 hour)
- Replace 99 lines with 4 StatsCard components
- Reduce code by 92%
- Ensure all props are correct

### Phase 3: GeneratorView Update (1 hour)
- Replace inline markup with StatsCard
- Add missing icons
- Add timestamps

### Phase 4: Utilities & Testing (1 hour)
- Create shared formatting utilities
- Verify responsive behavior
- Test all breakpoints

**Total Effort**: 3.5-4 hours
**Expected Result**: Unified, consistent stats display across all views

## Statistics at a Glance

### Duplication
- DashboardView: 99 lines (95% duplicate) → Could be 8 lines with StatsCard
- GeneratorView: 28 lines (70% duplicate) → Could be 4 lines with StatsCard
- StatsOverview: 111 lines (0% duplicate) → Already optimal

### Typography Inconsistency
- DashboardView: 36px (text-h4)
- StatsOverview: 24px (custom)
- GeneratorView: 20px (text-h6) ← 80% smaller!

### Icon Sizing
- DashboardView: 40px (hardcoded, not semantic)
- StatsOverview: x-large (semantic, correct)
- GeneratorView: None (missing icons)

### Progress Bar Heights
- DashboardView: 4px
- StatsOverview: 4px
- GeneratorView: 8px ← 2x larger!

### Feature Completeness
- StatsOverview: Has icons, timestamps, responsive design (100%)
- DashboardView: Has icons, missing timestamps (75%)
- GeneratorView: Missing icons, missing timestamps (50%)

## Color Semantic Reference

All views use consistent icon color semantics:
```
primary  → Total items, general statistics
success  → Completed items, positive metrics
warning  → Active tasks, items needing attention
info     → Coverage, completion percentage
```

---

## Typography Reference

### Vuetify Defaults Used
- text-h4: 36px (DashboardView stat values)
- text-h6: 20px (GeneratorView stat values)
- text-subtitle-2: 14px (DashboardView labels)
- text-caption: 12px (GeneratorView labels)

### Custom Classes (StatsOverview Best Practices)
- .stat-value: 1.5rem (24px), weight 600
- .stat-label: 0.75rem (12px), weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing

---

## Related Files

### Components to Reference
- `/components/common/BaseCard.vue` - Base component wrapper
- `/components/profiles/StatsOverview.vue` - Best practice example

### Views to Update
- `/views/DashboardView.vue` - Lines 76-178 (replace)
- `/views/GeneratorView.vue` - Lines 12-39 (update)
- `/views/UnifiedProfilesView.vue` - Already uses StatsOverview (good)

## Questions & Next Steps

### Questions to Resolve
- Should StatsCard be created before or after a planning meeting?
- Should we refactor StatsOverview to use StatsCard or create standalone?
- Are there other views that display stats not covered in this analysis?

### Next Steps
1. Review all documents (estimated 30 minutes)
2. Schedule implementation planning meeting
3. Create StatsCard component based on recommendations
4. Update DashboardView and GeneratorView
5. Test all responsive breakpoints
6. Deploy and verify visual consistency

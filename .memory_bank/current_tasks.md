  - Files: frontend-vue/src/stores/auth.ts, router/index.ts, services/api.ts, types/api.ts
- [x] [BUG-08] Fix Profile Generator page design inconsistency (2025-10-26)
  - Removed light-colored surface-variant background from statistics card
  - Applied consistent card styling across all cards (elevation="2" rounded="lg")
  - Matched design pattern used in Dashboard view
  - Updated GeneratorView.vue, BrowseTreeTab.vue for visual consistency
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/views/GeneratorView.vue, frontend-vue/src/components/generator/BrowseTreeTab.vue
- [x] [REFACTOR-02] Create BaseCard component and eliminate code duplication (2025-10-26)

  - Files: BaseCard.vue (new), DashboardView.vue, GeneratorView.vue, BrowseTreeTab.vue
  - Docs: frontend-vue/src/components/common/README.md, docs/implementation/BASECARD_REFACTORING.md
- [x] [BUG-09] Fix incorrect statistics on Profile Generator page (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: Statistics showed 567 (business units count) instead of actual positions count (~1487+)
  - **Root cause**: Frontend expected flat position list with profile_exists field, but backend returned nested business units
  - **Solution**: Created new `/api/organization/positions` endpoint that:
    - Flattens business units into position list (each business unit has positions array)
    - Joins with profiles table to provide profile_exists and profile_id fields
    - Returns accurate statistics (total_count, positions_with_profiles, coverage_percentage)
  - **Frontend changes**: Updated catalog store to call new endpoint instead of /search-items
  - **Impact**: Fixes broken statistics display and search functionality (PositionSearchAutocomplete)
  - **Backwards compatibility**: Old /search-items endpoint preserved unchanged
  - Files: backend/api/organization.py (new endpoint lines 119-257), frontend-vue/src/stores/catalog.ts (line 119)
- [x] [BUG-10] Fix browser freeze and tree navigation issues (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem A**: Browser freezes when navigating organization tree with "Maximum recursive updates exceeded" error
  - **Problem B**: EXPAND ALL and COLLAPSE ALL buttons don't work
  - **Root cause A**: Infinite reactive loop between two watchers in OrganizationTree.vue (modelValue watch → selected update → emit update:modelValue → modelValue watch...)
  - **Root cause B**: Using boolean prop instead of managing opened nodes array; incorrect prop configuration (return-object conflict with item-value)
  - **Solution**:
    - Added equality checks in both watchers to prevent unnecessary updates
    - Implemented v-model:opened for proper tree state management
    - Created expandAll() and collapseAll() methods exposed via defineExpose()
    - Removed return-object prop to avoid ID/object conflicts
    - Added deep tree traversal to collect all node IDs for expansion
  - **Impact**: Resolves browser freeze, enables proper tree navigation, EXPAND ALL/COLLAPSE ALL now work correctly
  - **Tree depth**: Supports 6 levels of hierarchy (division → block → department → unit → unit → unit)
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/components/generator/OrganizationTree.vue, frontend-vue/src/components/generator/BrowseTreeTab.vue, frontend-vue/src/stores/catalog.ts
- [x] [UX-11] Implement dual selection buttons for organization tree (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: When selecting a unit (e.g., "IT Development Management"), only direct positions were selected, not positions in nested sub-units
  - **User need**: Two distinct selection modes - direct positions only vs. all nested positions recursively
  - **Solution**: Replaced single "Select All" button with two adaptive buttons:
    - **"Direct (N)"** - selects only positions directly under this unit (non-recursive)
    - **"All (M)"** - selects all positions including nested children (recursive)
  - **UX features**:
    - Both buttons use `variant="outlined"` for equal visual weight
    - Tooltips explain difference: "Select only positions directly under this unit" vs "Select all positions including nested units"
    - Adaptive responsive design: Desktop (icons+text), Tablet (text only), Mobile (compact "Dir: N" / "All: M")
    - Toggle behavior: click again to deselect
  - **Technical implementation**:
    - Added `collectAllPositionIdsRecursive()` helper for recursive ID collection
    - Renamed `selectAllPositions()` → `selectDirectPositions()` for clarity
    - Created `selectAllNestedPositions()` for recursive selection
    - Breakpoints: Desktop (≥960px), Tablet (600-959px), Mobile (<600px)
  - **Icons**: `mdi-file-document-outline` (Direct), `mdi-file-tree` (All)
  - **Impact**: Users can now efficiently select entire departments with all nested positions, or just top-level positions as needed
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/components/generator/OrganizationTree.vue
- [x] [REFACTOR-03] Code quality improvements for UX-11 (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: Code review identified 5 improvement areas: DRY violation (6 repeated button blocks), type safety (`any` used 7 times), hardcoded strings, missing tests, undocumented breakpoints
  - **Improvements implemented**:
    1. **Type Safety**: Created `TreeItem` interface, replaced all 7 instances of `any` with proper types
    2. **DRY Principle**: Extracted `TreeSelectionButton` component, eliminated 100+ lines of repetitive code
    3. **i18n Preparation**: Created `constants/treeSelection.ts` with all UI strings, icons, and breakpoint configurations
    4. **Documentation**: Documented Vuetify breakpoint logic and responsive design patterns
    5. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/components/OrganizationTree.spec.ts` with 15+ test cases
  - **New files created**:
    - `TreeSelectionButton.vue`: Reusable selection button component with responsive design
    - `constants/treeSelection.ts`: Centralized constants for i18n and configuration (85 lines)
    - `OrganizationTree.spec.ts`: Unit tests covering edge cases and deep hierarchy (240+ lines)
    - `TreeSelectionButton.README.md`: Complete component documentation
  - **Code metrics**:
    - Lines of code reduced: ~100 lines in template (6 blocks → 2 loops)
- [x] [BUG-12] Fix profile generation 422 error and remove settings form (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem A**: Profile generation completely broken with 422 Unprocessable Entity error
  - **Problem B**: Form shows unnecessary fields (employee name, temperature slider)
  - **Root cause**: Frontend sent wrong field names (`position_name`, `business_unit_name`) while backend expected (`position`, `department`)
  - **Solution**:
    - Fixed API field mapping in generator.ts: `business_unit_name` → `department`, `position_name` → `position`
    - Fixed response parsing bug: `response.data.data` → `response.data` (3 locations)
    - Removed GenerationForm.vue component (164 lines) and all references
    - Temperature now managed via Langfuse config (0.1), not UI
  - **Impact**: Profile generation now works, cleaner UX without unnecessary settings
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/stores/generator.ts, frontend-vue/src/components/generator/GenerationForm.vue (deleted), QuickSearchTab.vue, BrowseTreeTab.vue
- [x] [REFACTOR-04] Complete API унификация (BaseResponse pattern) (2025-10-26)

    - `BASERESPONSE_TEST_UPDATES.md`: Test update patterns
  - **Backward compatibility**: 100% maintained - zero breaking changes
  - **Impact**: Consistent, type-safe API across entire application
  - Files: 18 files updated across backend, frontend, tests, and scripts
- [x] [TESTS-02] Unit tests для новых Pydantic моделей + Code Review fixes (2025-10-26)
  - **Context**: After REFACTOR-04 completion, comprehensive code review identified 3 medium-priority issues
  - **Issues found and fixed**:
    1. **Missing type hints**: Added complete type hints for `convert_structure()` function in organization.py
    2. **Weak typing**: Replaced `Dict[str, str]` with strongly typed `DataSources` Pydantic model
    3. **No unit tests**: Created comprehensive test suite for all 28 new Pydantic models

- [x] [BUG-12] Fix profile generation 422 error and remove settings form (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem A**: 422 Unprocessable Entity error when starting profile generation
  - **Problem B**: Settings form (temperature, employee name) not needed per user requirements
  - **Root cause**: Frontend-backend API field mismatch
    - Frontend sent: `position_id`, `position_name`, `business_unit_name`, `temperature`, `employee_name`
    - Backend expected: `department`, `position` (required), `temperature`, `employee_name` (optional with defaults)
  - **Solution**: Frontend-only changes (backend API unchanged for safety)
    - Fixed API request mapping: `business_unit_name` → `department`, `position_name` → `position`
    - Removed `position_id` from request (not used by backend)
    - Removed `temperature` and `employee_name` parameters (using Langfuse defaults: temperature=0.1)
    - Removed `GenerationConfig` interface and `generationConfig` state from generator store
    - Removed `updateConfig()` action from generator store
    - Deleted `GenerationForm.vue` component (164 lines)
    - Removed GenerationForm from QuickSearchTab and BrowseTreeTab
    - Simplified UX: removed configuration step, direct "Find → Generate" workflow
  - **Testing**: Verified generation works for "Заместитель генерального директора по безопасности" (previously failing position)
  - **Impact**:
    - ✅ Fixed 422 error - generation now works correctly
    - ✅ Simplified UX - removed unnecessary configuration step
    - ✅ Settings now managed via Langfuse (centralized prompt management)
    - ✅ Cleaner code - removed unused interfaces and components
  - Files:
    - frontend-vue/src/stores/generator.ts (API mapping, cleanup)
    - frontend-vue/src/components/generator/QuickSearchTab.vue (removed form)
    - frontend-vue/src/components/generator/BrowseTreeTab.vue (removed form)

  - **Solution**: Unified ALL API endpoints to use BaseResponse format following industry best practices
  - **Changes**:
    - **Backend (5 files + 28 new models)**:
      - Added 28 new response models in backend/models/schemas.py (Generation, Organization, Dashboard, Catalog)

      - Updated services: catalog.service.ts (fixed parsing bug), dashboard.service.ts, profile.service.ts, generation.service.ts
      - Added TypeScript types in types/api.ts (3 new interfaces)
      - Created documentation: docs/implementation/FRONTEND_API_UNIFICATION_REPORT.md
    - **Tests & Scripts (6 files)**:
      - Updated tests/integration/test_api_endpoints.py
      - Updated tests/integration/test_generation_flow.py
      - Updated tests/integration/test_e2e_user_journeys.py
      - Updated scripts/universal_profile_generator.py
      - Updated scripts/it_department_profile_generator.py

  - **Unified Format**: All endpoints now return:
    ```json
    {
      "success": bool,
      "timestamp": datetime,
      "message": optional string,
      ...endpoint-specific fields
    }
    ```
  - **Testing**: Verified all endpoints work correctly:
    - ✅ POST /api/generation/start - Returns BaseResponse with task_id
    - ✅ GET /api/organization/search-items - Returns BaseResponse with data.items
    - ✅ GET /api/dashboard/stats - Returns BaseResponse with data.summary
    - ✅ All existing functionality preserved
  - **Benefits**:
    - ✅ Type safety - All responses validated by Pydantic
    - ✅ Consistency - Uniform format across project
    - ✅ Documentation - Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs
    - ✅ Maintainability - Single source of truth for API contracts
    - ✅ Error handling - Consistent error response format
  - **Backward Compatibility**: 100% - All existing field names and structures preserved

  - Added error recovery in router guard (try-catch around initialize)
  - Fixed dual token storage issue (auth:unauthorized event system)
  - Replaced unsafe type casting with proper type guards in DashboardView
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/stores/auth.ts, router/index.ts, services/api.ts, types/api.ts
- [x] [BUG-08] Fix Profile Generator page design inconsistency (2025-10-26)
  - Removed light-colored surface-variant background from statistics card
  - Applied consistent card styling across all cards (elevation="2" rounded="lg")
  - Matched design pattern used in Dashboard view
  - Updated GeneratorView.vue, BrowseTreeTab.vue for visual consistency
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/views/GeneratorView.vue, frontend-vue/src/components/generator/BrowseTreeTab.vue
- [x] [REFACTOR-02] Create BaseCard component and eliminate code duplication (2025-10-26)
  - Created reusable BaseCard component for consistent card styling across application
  - Refactored DashboardView (6 cards), GeneratorView (3 cards), BrowseTreeTab (1 card)
  - Eliminated 9+ repetitions of `elevation="2" rounded="lg"` pattern
  - Added comprehensive documentation (README.md, JSDoc, implementation guide)
  - Improved maintainability: single source of truth for card styling
  - Zero visual changes, zero performance impact
  - Files: BaseCard.vue (new), DashboardView.vue, GeneratorView.vue, BrowseTreeTab.vue
  - Docs: frontend-vue/src/components/common/README.md, docs/implementation/BASECARD_REFACTORING.md
- [x] [BUG-09] Fix incorrect statistics on Profile Generator page (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: Statistics showed 567 (business units count) instead of actual positions count (~1487+)
  - **Root cause**: Frontend expected flat position list with profile_exists field, but backend returned nested business units
  - **Solution**: Created new `/api/organization/positions` endpoint that:
    - Flattens business units into position list (each business unit has positions array)
    - Joins with profiles table to provide profile_exists and profile_id fields
    - Returns accurate statistics (total_count, positions_with_profiles, coverage_percentage)
  - **Frontend changes**: Updated catalog store to call new endpoint instead of /search-items
  - **Impact**: Fixes broken statistics display and search functionality (PositionSearchAutocomplete)
  - **Backwards compatibility**: Old /search-items endpoint preserved unchanged
  - Files: backend/api/organization.py (new endpoint lines 119-257), frontend-vue/src/stores/catalog.ts (line 119)
- [x] [BUG-10] Fix browser freeze and tree navigation issues (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem A**: Browser freezes when navigating organization tree with "Maximum recursive updates exceeded" error
  - **Problem B**: EXPAND ALL and COLLAPSE ALL buttons don't work
  - **Root cause A**: Infinite reactive loop between two watchers in OrganizationTree.vue (modelValue watch → selected update → emit update:modelValue → modelValue watch...)
  - **Root cause B**: Using boolean prop instead of managing opened nodes array; incorrect prop configuration (return-object conflict with item-value)
  - **Solution**:
    - Added equality checks in both watchers to prevent unnecessary updates
    - Implemented v-model:opened for proper tree state management
    - Created expandAll() and collapseAll() methods exposed via defineExpose()
    - Removed return-object prop to avoid ID/object conflicts
    - Added deep tree traversal to collect all node IDs for expansion
  - **Impact**: Resolves browser freeze, enables proper tree navigation, EXPAND ALL/COLLAPSE ALL now work correctly
  - **Tree depth**: Supports 6 levels of hierarchy (division → block → department → unit → unit → unit)
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/components/generator/OrganizationTree.vue, frontend-vue/src/components/generator/BrowseTreeTab.vue, frontend-vue/src/stores/catalog.ts
- [x] [UX-11] Implement dual selection buttons for organization tree (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: When selecting a unit (e.g., "IT Development Management"), only direct positions were selected, not positions in nested sub-units
  - **User need**: Two distinct selection modes - direct positions only vs. all nested positions recursively
  - **Solution**: Replaced single "Select All" button with two adaptive buttons:
    - **"Direct (N)"** - selects only positions directly under this unit (non-recursive)
    - **"All (M)"** - selects all positions including nested children (recursive)
  - **UX features**:
    - Both buttons use `variant="outlined"` for equal visual weight
    - Tooltips explain difference: "Select only positions directly under this unit" vs "Select all positions including nested units"
    - Adaptive responsive design: Desktop (icons+text), Tablet (text only), Mobile (compact "Dir: N" / "All: M")
    - Toggle behavior: click again to deselect
  - **Technical implementation**:
    - Added `collectAllPositionIdsRecursive()` helper for recursive ID collection
    - Renamed `selectAllPositions()` → `selectDirectPositions()` for clarity
    - Created `selectAllNestedPositions()` for recursive selection
    - Breakpoints: Desktop (≥960px), Tablet (600-959px), Mobile (<600px)
  - **Icons**: `mdi-file-document-outline` (Direct), `mdi-file-tree` (All)
  - **Impact**: Users can now efficiently select entire departments with all nested positions, or just top-level positions as needed
  - Files: frontend-vue/src/components/generator/OrganizationTree.vue
- [x] [REFACTOR-03] Code quality improvements for UX-11 (2025-10-26)
  - **Problem**: Code review identified 5 improvement areas: DRY violation (6 repeated button blocks), type safety (`any` used 7 times), hardcoded strings, missing tests, undocumented breakpoints
  - **Improvements implemented**:
    1. **Type Safety**: Created `TreeItem` interface, replaced all 7 instances of `any` with proper types
    2. **DRY Principle**: Extracted `TreeSelectionButton` component, eliminated 100+ lines of repetitive code
    3. **i18n Preparation**: Created `constants/treeSelection.ts` with all UI strings, icons, and breakpoint configurations
    4. **Documentation**: Documented Vuetify breakpoint logic and responsive design patterns
    5. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/components/OrganizationTree.spec.ts` with 15+ test cases
  - **New files created**:
    - `TreeSelectionButton.vue`: Reusable selection button component with responsive design
    - `constants/treeSelection.ts`: Centralized constants for i18n and configuration (85 lines)
    - `OrganizationTree.spec.ts`: Unit tests covering edge cases and deep hierarchy (240+ lines)
    - `TreeSelectionButton.README.md`: Complete component documentation
  - **Code metrics**:
    - Lines of code reduced: ~100 lines in template (6 blocks → 2 loops)
    - Type safety: 100% (0 `any` types remaining)
    - Test coverage: 15+ test cases covering all edge cases
    - i18n readiness: 100% (all strings extracted)
  - **Technical details**:
    - Responsive breakpoints: Desktop (≥960px), Tablet (600-959px), Mobile (<600px)
    - Helper functions: `getButtonText()`, `getTooltipText()`, `getIconName()`, `getBreakpointClass()`
    - Accessibility: ARIA labels and descriptive tooltips
  - **Impact**: Improved code maintainability, type safety, testability, and i18n readiness; easier to add features in future

    - frontend-vue/src/components/generator/OrganizationTree.vue (refactored)
    - frontend-vue/src/components/generator/TreeSelectionButton.vue (new)
    - frontend-vue/src/constants/treeSelection.ts (new)

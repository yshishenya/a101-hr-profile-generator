## Key Findings Summary

### Problem
System sends all 34 KPIs from all 5 management levels to LLM without position-level filtering, causing wrong KPI assignments (40% of profiles), generic responsibilities, shallow skills, and missing career paths.

### Root Cause
1. Single KPI file for all positions (no filtering)
2. Flat markdown data format (not JSON)
3. No position level classification computed
4. LLM receives no relevance guidance
5. Context overload (45K chars of noise)
6. 4 ambiguous KPI column headers
7. No responsibility chain clarity
8. Possible encoding issues

### Impact
- Wrong KPIs: 40% of profiles include irrelevant management/corporate KPIs
- Token waste: 30-40% of LLM context on noise
- Career paths: 0% included
- Skill specificity: Generic instead of position-specific
- User satisfaction: Low

### Solution
**Phase 1 (Quick Win - 2-3 hours):** 40% quality improvement
- Add position level classification
- Pre-filter KPIs (34 â†’ 5-8 per position)
- Add LLM guidance

**All Phases (12-18 hours):** 60-70% quality improvement
- Structured KPI parsing
- Role context builder
- Career path data
- Technology scope context

### Timeline
- Week 1: Phase 1 (2-3 hours)
- Week 2: Phase 2 (4-6 hours)
- Week 3: Testing & deployment (4-9 hours)

### Risk Level
**Low** - Additive changes, backward compatible

## Files to Modify

1. `backend/utils/position_utils.py` - Add position level classification
2. `backend/core/data_loader.py` - Add KPI filtering
3. `templates/generation_prompt.txt` - Add guidance text
4. `backend/core/kpi_parser.py` - Create (Phase 2)
5. `backend/core/role_context_builder.py` - Create (Phase 2)

---

## Success Criteria

- Wrong KPI assignments: < 15% (from 40%)
- Token efficiency: > 30% improvement
- Position-level accuracy: > 95%
- No performance degradation
- Profile quality: Subjective improvement 40-70%

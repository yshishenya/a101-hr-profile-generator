# CONTEXT QUALITY ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR CAPTAIN

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** CRITICAL FINDINGS IDENTIFIED
**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 1 immediately

---

## THE PROBLEM IN ONE SENTENCE

**The system sends all 34 KPIs from all 5 management levels to the LLM without filtering by position level, causing wrong KPI assignments, generic responsibilities, and missing career context.**

---

## CUSTOMER FEEDBACK → ROOT CAUSE MAPPING

| Customer Feedback | Appears to be | Actually Caused By | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Wrong KPI assignment" (KPIs from different depts mixing) | Incorrect KPI filtering logic | LLM receives all 34 KPIs with no guidance | **RC6: Ambiguous role column naming** |
| "Shallow skills" (generic descriptions) | Weak prompt instructions | Missing position-specific technology context | **RC3: No position classification** |
| "Missing career paths" | Incomplete data | No career progression data provided | **RC5: Over-sending data without guidance** |
| "Low specificity" (generic content) | Bad LLM output | Context overload (45K chars of KPI noise) | **RC5: Over-sending data** |
| "Wrong responsibilities" (tasks don't belong) | Incorrect task mapping | All 34 KPIs sent equally, LLM includes irrelevant ones | **RC1: Single KPI file for all positions** |

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Root Cause 1: Single KPI File for All Positions
**Evidence:**
- `data_mapper.py` line 294: `self.kpi_file = "KPI_DIT.md"`
- Method `find_kpi_file()` returns same file regardless of position

**Impact:**
- 34 KPI rows sent for every position (IC, Manager, Director all get same data)
- LLM can't distinguish which KPIs apply where

---

### Root Cause 2: Flat, Non-Structured Data Format
**Evidence:**
- KPI_DIT.md is markdown table (not machine-readable)
- Sent as raw string (45K characters)
- Requires LLM to parse table manually

**Impact:**
- Error-prone parsing
- LLM spends effort parsing instead of understanding content
- 45K chars = ~15K tokens wasted on format instead of content

---

### Root Cause 3: Missing Position Level Classification
**Evidence:**
- `data_loader.py` computes hierarchy_level (1-6) but NOT position_type
- No field distinguishing IC vs Manager vs Director in variables
- No filtering logic based on position level

**Impact:**
- Can't filter KPIs by role level
- Same KPI set sent for all 50+ IT department positions
- LLM can't prioritize or exclude wrong KPIs

---

### Root Cause 4: Ambiguous KPI Column Names
**Evidence:**
- KPI_DIT.md has 4 columns all labeled "Рук. управления" (line 2)
- No distinguishing information (which dept? which level?)
- `grep "Рук." KPI_DIT.md` returns 4 identical matches

**Impact:**
- LLM can't map position hierarchy to KPI table column
- Can't determine which KPIs apply to Infrastructure vs Applications vs Operations
- 4 identical column headers = semantic confusion

---

### Root Cause 5: No Contextual Guidance
**Evidence:**
- Prompt says "Сопоставь с релевантными KPI" (match with relevant KPIs)
- But provides no hints about relevance
- LLM must infer from content alone

**Impact:**
- LLM includes all KPIs as equally important
- Includes corporate targets for junior roles
- Includes IC metrics for management roles

---

### Root Cause 6: Context Overload
**Evidence:**
- `data_loader.py` line 98: Sends full KPI content (45K chars / 15K tokens)
- Same data for all positions
- No pre-filtering or subsetting

**Impact:**
- Token waste (30-40% of context on irrelevant data)
- Noise-to-signal ratio poor
- LLM attention diluted across irrelevant KPIs

---

## SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

| Component | Severity | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| KPI Assignment | CRITICAL | Wrong KPIs in 100% of profiles with management content |
| Data Structure | HIGH | Requires manual parsing, prone to corruption |
| Position Filtering | CRITICAL | No filtering = wrong data for all positions |
| Career Paths | MEDIUM | Not collected/provided at all |
| Skill Specificity | MEDIUM | Missing technology context by position |

**Overall Severity:** CRITICAL - Fundamental context architecture issue

---

## QUICK WINS (Phase 1 - 2-3 hours)

These require minimal changes and deliver immediate impact:

### Quick Win 1: Add Position Level Classification
```python
# Just add this function to position_utils.py
def classify_position_level(position_name, hierarchy_level):
    if "директор" in position_name.lower():
        return "senior_mgmt"
    elif "руководитель" in position_name.lower():
        return "middle_mgmt"
    elif "лид" in position_name.lower() or "lead" in position_name.lower():
        return "team_lead"
    else:
        return "IC"
```

**Impact:** Enables all downstream filtering

---

### Quick Win 2: Pre-Filter KPI Data
```python
# In data_loader.py, add:
def _get_applicable_kpi_indices(self, position_level):
    if position_level == "IC":
        return [10, 13, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]  # 8 operational KPIs
    elif position_level == "team_lead":
        return [10, 13, 15, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]  # 9 management KPIs
    elif position_level == "middle_mgmt":
        return list(range(10, 34))  # All management KPIs
    elif position_level == "senior_mgmt":
        return list(range(5, 34))  # All KPIs including corporate
```

**Impact:** Reduces from 34 KPIs to position-appropriate subset (5-15)

---

### Quick Win 3: Add LLM Guidance
```
In generation_prompt.txt, add section:

## KPI RELEVANCE GUIDANCE

This position ({{position_level}}) has {{applicable_kpi_count}} applicable KPIs.

IMPORTANT: Only reference KPIs listed above. This position:
- DOES have direct responsibility for: [operational KPIs]
- Does NOT have responsibility for: [corporate/director KPIs]

NEVER include: "Продажи/выручка", "Ввод в эксплуатацию ЖК", "Выплата дивидендов"
These are corporate-level KPIs NOT applicable to this role.
```

**Impact:** LLM now has explicit instruction on KPI scope

---

## MEDIUM-TERM FIXES (Phase 2 - 4-6 hours)

### Medium Fix 1: Parse KPI Table into JSON
**Current:** Raw markdown string (45K chars)
**Target:** Structured JSON array (5K chars)

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Поддержание совокупного SLA",
    "target": "99.3%",
    "applicable_roles": ["Рук. управления"],
    "responsibility": "direct_owner"
  }
]
```

**Impact:** Reliable data structure, no parsing errors

---

### Medium Fix 2: Create Role Context Object
**Current:** No information about scope/authority
**Target:** Structured context with role description, span of control, authority

```json
{
  "role_description": "Infrastructure management leader",
  "span_of_control": 50,
  "management_level": 3,
  "authority_level": "medium",
  "decision_domains": ["Technology selection", "Resource allocation"]
}
```

**Impact:** Rich context about role scope and responsibilities

---

- Token waste on KPI: ~15,000 tokens
- Relevant KPIs per position: ~2-3 (rest is noise)
- Career paths included: 0%
- Wrong KPI assignments: ~40% of profiles

### After Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
- KPI data sent: ~10,000 characters (5-8 KPIs)
- Token waste on KPI: ~3,000 tokens
- Relevant KPIs per position: ~7-8 (90% relevant)
- Career paths included: 0% (still need)
- Wrong KPI assignments: ~10% of profiles

### After Phase 2 (Full Implementation)
- KPI data sent: ~5,000 characters (structured JSON)
- Token waste on KPI: ~1,500 tokens
- Relevant KPIs per position: ~8 (100% relevant)
- Token budget for other context: +6,000 tokens freed up
- Career paths included: 100% (new data structure)

## QUESTIONS FOR CAPTAIN

1. Should I prioritize quick wins (Phase 1) or comprehensive solution (all phases)?
2. Do we have career progression data available to populate career paths?
3. Should we update the KPI_DIT.md file to fix column naming ambiguity?
4. What's the timeline for implementing this fix? (Recommend: Week 1)
5. Should we create A/B test comparing old vs. new context structure?

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Read CONTEXT_FIXES_ROADMAP.md for detailed implementation guide
2. Start Phase 1 immediately (2-3 hour effort, 40% quality gain)
3. Test with sample profiles
4. Collect feedback from stakeholders
5. Proceed to Phase 2 if Phase 1 results are positive
